# Terraform Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Terraform Mini-Projects Compilation repository! This repository serves as a collection of mini-projects that demonstrate my Terraform skills, with a focus on deploying infrastructure in Microsoft Azure.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a series of mini-projects, each located in its own dedicated folder. Each mini-project is designed to cover specific Terraform concepts, best practices, and use cases, showcasing my ability to:

- Organize Terraform code effectively
- Implement modularization and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Deploy infrastructure in Microsoft Azure
- Utilize Terraform's features like `for_each` loops, conditional expressions, and modules


## Mini-Projects

Here's a list of the mini-projects you can explore within this repository:

1. [Azure Virtual Machines with Network Security Groups](azure_vm_nsg_project/README.md) - Deploy Azure VMs with associated NSGs.

[Add more mini-projects here as you create them.]

Each mini-project folder contains a `README.md` file with details on the Terraform configuration structure and how to use the code to deploy the specified infrastructure.
