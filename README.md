# Terraform Mini-Projects

Welcome to my Terraform Mini-Projects Compilation repository! This repository serves as a collection of mini-projects that demonstrate my Terraform skills, with a focus on deploying infrastructure in Microsoft Azure.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a series of mini-projects, each located in its own dedicated folder. Each mini-project is designed to cover specific Terraform concepts, best practices, and use cases, showcasing my ability to:

- Organize Terraform code effectively
- Implement modularization and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Deploy infrastructure in Microsoft Azure
- Utilize Terraform's features like `for_each` loops, conditional expressions, and modules
